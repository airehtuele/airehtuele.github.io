Hi ! Welcome to my page, my name is Anastasia, currently an undergraduate at Yonsei University double majoring in Information and Interaction Design and Bioconvergence. 


I also very much enjoy making art and participate in design projects, you can check out my work [here]([http://reddit.com](https://airehtuele.github.io/projects/)).
