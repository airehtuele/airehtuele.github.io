Hi ! Welcome to my page, my name is Anastasia, currently an undergraduate at Yonsei University double majoring in Information and Interaction Design and Bioconvergence. Currently focused on exploring new ways to support and heal both mind and body. My projects span a variety of disciplines such as HCI, Body Data Visualisation, Physical Computing and Immunoengineering.




I also very much enjoy making art and participating in design projectsâ€”you can check out my work [here]((https://airehtuele.github.io/projects/)).
