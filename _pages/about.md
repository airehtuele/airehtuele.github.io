Hi ! Welcome to my page, my name is Anastasia, currently an undergraduate at Yonsei University double majoring in Information and Interaction Design and Bioconvergence. My multidisciplinary research focuses on Biosensors, Human-Machine Interfaces and Human-AI Interaction.

I also very much enjoy making art and participate in design projects, you can check out my work[here]([http://reddit.com](https://airehtuele.github.io/projects/)).

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
